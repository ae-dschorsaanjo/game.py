Are you boring and don't know what to do? Do some sum in your head! Or improve this little game ;)

It is a quite simple "game" for practicing math or just waste some time, e.g. in a boring class.

The original version of it was written in C# and that was actually for get through some boring classes. After it was finished (along with a lot of bugs and extremely ugly and amateur coding "style"), me and one friend of mine played with it.

And now about this program:

It has two game modes, the "finite" and "infinite" game. You can choose between these modes when you type the number of games. You should type an 0 for an infinite game and type a number between 1 and 1024 for a finite game. The difference is simple; a finite game is give you _number of games_ expressions and then a statistics. An infinite game otherwise give you expressions so far as you type correct answers.

I may never will update this tiny game, although if someone find a bug, I'll fix it and then update the game.
I may will update this game though, if I think so and want some new goodies for it.

If you'll find a bug or something irritating in the code, let me know and you won't find that thing anymore!

_PS: sorry for the stupid style_
