*Are you boring and don't know what to do? Do some sum in your head! Or improve this little game ;)*

It is a quite simple "game" for practicing math or just waste some time, e.g. in a boring class (though playing in a class is not recommended).

The original version of it was written in C# (with a lot of bugs and extremely ugly and amateur coding "style").

# How to ~~use~~ play

It has two game modes, the "finite" and "infinite" game. You can choose between these modes when you type the number of games. You should type an 0 for an infinite game and type a number between 1 and 1024 for a finite game.
This game has two game modes, "finite" and "infinite". The difference is simple; a finite game will give you _number of games_ expressions. An infinite game otherwise give you expressions as far as you type correct answers.

If you'll find a bug or something irritating in the code, please let me know.
